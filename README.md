I relied on this article: https://shorturl.at/vBUWY for understanding a PE 
file format structure. I didn't read everything, yet, but I thought, that 
would intersting write an own small system for display a various data from 
PE files. Ya, I understand, that a some text file would copes with this task, 
but on that moment I already was keen on it. (Ah, its marvelous moments, 
when you write a code... Write at day, at night... Just write and have delight.) 
In general, the project isn't finished yet. I will upload it right after committing 
this text (there is several words about the repository, while I'm relaxing).

Well, in essentially, this system is just set of non-GUI widgets for console 
windows (in Windows), which accepts a data and display it through a buffer 
(honestly, there is an one widget, yet - the spoiler). So, you can drag a PE 
file (.dll, .exe) onto a console screen or specify its path in arguments to 
get a partial (for now) information about it. And... that's all. Yes, so simple.
